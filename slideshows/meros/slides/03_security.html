		<p>MerOS is secure because GNU/Linux is secure by its open, low priviledge nature which don't get easily affected by viruses.</p>
		<p>MerOS is more secure than others thanks to being Nix based, simplifying the deployment and having a read-only root filesystem so you can't easily ruin the system.</p>
